"""
based on the geometry of the maze the robot will not get trapped by obstacles 
so long as the obstacles are not heavily around the perimeter (outside) of the maze,
since there are only 3 obstacles the outer wall would have to be obstructing the robot
for the robot to be blocked in 4 directions

therefore if you can create a normal distrubution with the same center of the maze (2.5)
with a low standard deviation, then randomly select numbers from that distrubution, 
the numbers selected will almost always be toward the center of the maze.

It would be virtually impossible for all 3 obstacles to be along or near the perimeter,
therefore the robot would not be trapped
